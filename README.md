## Deep Learning and Matrix Factorization Model for Restaurant Recommendation

### Dataset

#### 1 [5lood3li/Capstone_Project]
The dataset used in this project is adapted from [5lood3li/Capstone_Project](https://github.com/5lood3li/Capstone_Project).

We have performed the following preprocessing and adaptations to suit the needs of this project:
 - Encoding restaurant names as numerical values.
 - Synthesized user identifiers, resulting in 1062 distinct user profiles.
 - The updated dataset contains 6452 instances.

#### 2 Yelp database
We utilized a sample of 20,883 reviews -driven from 1,148 distinct users and 14,569 businesses.
The key features—user ID, business ID, and rating—were aligned with our primary analysis.

### RBM implementation
